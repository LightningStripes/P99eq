*** Halloween Events ***

- Corrected an issue with character flagging in the Halloween events.  Previously only the Trick-or-Treat event and the "Out with the Old" mission were giving credit for completion. 
- Due to the issues in the Halloween events the time they will be available has been increased. The events will now remain available until the morning of Monday, November 14th.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Artisan Dosan Vis'Moor, Vivian Selgan, and Gart Okken should now be accepting items for the tasks that they give.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Zoning out from the Corathus Mines will now place you at the location from which you zoned in.
- Addressed character creation issues on Firiona Vie.
- Corrected several issues with Veteran rewards.
