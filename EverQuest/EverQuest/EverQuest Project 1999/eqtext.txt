Please check and make sure that you do not have more than one directory with EverQuest installed or that you are running from a directory with Luclin installed.  For assistance with this problem, please call (858)-537-0898, or visit our website at http://www.everquest.com and go to the Luclin support area and check out the document titled 'Can't find Luclin Files'.\n\nWARNING:  Because you are able to access Luclin content, but do not have the files installed with your currently running EverQuest directory we can not guarantee that you will be able to access the game.

431 Texture Caching
432 This improves load time on many systems, at the expense of using extra disk space. The first time you load any zone or the character selection screen with caching on, it will take time to build the cache.  After that load times should be reduced. Changing your settings here will require new caches to be built the next time you play.  Recommended <%s>

When you pre-order, the "Legacy of Ykesha" box on the second page of the client patcher will be checkmarked - so that each time you patch, the patch routine will check for new extension files and download them to you.
