Installing Kunark Login Screen

1. Unzip all 6 .tga files.
2. Place them in your C:/Program Files/Sony/Everquest/uifiles/Default/ directory. 
	You might want to backup the files you are replacing first!

Or if you use a custom UI, you should make sure you place the .tga files in that directory instead.

ex: C:/Program Files/Sony/Everquest/uifiles/Japino_Classic_UI/EQLS_background_01.tga
							      EQLS_background_02.tga			
							      EQLS_background_03.tga
							      EQLS_background_04.tga
							      EQLS_background_05.tga
							      EQLS_background_06.tga

*This installation guide assumes Everquest was installed in the default directory.
