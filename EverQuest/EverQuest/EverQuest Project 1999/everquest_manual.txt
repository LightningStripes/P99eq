** PLEASE NOTE YOU SHOULD ONLY USE THE IN_GAME HELP WHEN YOUR CHARACTER IS IN A SAFE PLACE!
 
 Clicking on the help button does not alleviate your character from the usual risks of being attacked.  Also know you have
 an option to use   the /help command to get help with /commands in-game as well.
 
** TO BROWSE THROUGH THIS HELP SECTION, USE THE PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN KEYS ON YOUR KEYBOARD **
 
 
/anon or /a [ON/OFF] - Makes you Anonymous in /who and /who all, preventing other players from seeing your class, level and
 current location.
 
/afk [ON/OFF] <text> - When activated, all private tells sent to the user will auto-respond with the following text, "You 
 told <players name>, 'Sorry, I am A.F.K. (Away from keyboard) right now.'".  If you add <text> then that text will replace
 the default AFK message.
 
/assist [target] or <character name> - if you target a character that is within 200', the /assist command will automatically
 target for you whoever that character has targeted at the moment- this can be very useful in heavy combat.  To be most 
 effective, it is best to set this as a Social.
 
/assist [ON/OFF] - Toggles the autoattack function associated with the /assist function.  The default of ON turns on your
 autoattack when you use /assist.  If you type /assist off then autoattack will not start when you use /assist.  This is 
 one case where you  must use the parameters on and off for this to work.
 
/attack [ON/OFF] - Toggles in and out of attack mode.  This will put you in attack mode even if nothing is targeted.  Be 
 careful not to use this when near NPC's that you have targeted.  By default, this is set to the "a" key.  Care should also
 be taken when you are near an NPC that you have targeted not to hit the "a" key, as this may cause you to attack the NPC.
 
/auction <text> - Allows users to send auction messages throughout the current zone.  Please use this channel only for 
 auctions.
 
/autojoin <channel-list> - Saves the channels listed and automatically ;sets you to those channels when you log in.  This

 in this manual about Chat Channels for more information.
 
/autosplit [ON/OFF] - automatically splits any loot you get with the rest of your party.  Each member must do this to split
 all loot.

/camp [desktop/server] - Allows the player to exit to the server select screen or desktop depending on what is specified.

/channel [gsay/ooc/shout/guild/auction] - toggles the chat channels on or off.

/corpse [target] - will summon the target's corpse if it is within a 50' radius of the character.  You can either target the 
 character or the character's corpse.  This will only work if the targeted character has used the /consent command on the 
 character trying to use the /corpse command.  If no target is selected when the /corpse command is used, it will summon your
 own character's corpse if it is within 50' of the character.
 
/decline - Declines a duel.
 
/disband [target] - Allows a character to disband from a group if he/she has themselves targeted.  This command also allows 
 the group leader to disband a targeted member of the group if they are in the same zone.
 
/dismount (Luclin Only) - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the 
 ability to do so using the bridle.  There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a horse.

 skill.
 
/duel or /d - challenges targeted PC to a duel - to accept, they have to type /d with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect
 until one combatant "dies" (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone.  Until the duel is resolved, the two combatants 
 can't be affected by  spells from PCs not in the duel, nor can they cast spells on those outside the duel.
 
/dynamiclights [ON/OFF] - When on, this command enables players to see specially rendered lighting.  This command is most 
 useful when the player is holding, or has a light source with them, such as a torch.  Turn this command to off if you 
 notice low frame rate.

 never be able to drop any items on the ground.  If set to on, no confirmation box will come up before dropping the item 
 on the ground.  Caution is advised as many  NPC's (Non player characters such as merchants) do pick up items dropped on
 the ground by players.

 list the players in your friends list.  A /who friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is in the zone you 
 are in, and a /who all friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is on the server you are on.  Your friends
 list can only contain 30 names per character.  And be aware that in order to remove someone from the list, you must type

/me - Same as /em
 
/mousespeed [0-3] - Changes the mouse travel speed across the monitor.  3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number

 petition is in the queue).
 
/played - Returns the birth date and hours played for the current character.
 
/quit - Immediately exits the game.  However, when you exit in this manner, your character has not 'camped out' in the 
 proper fashion, and he or she will remain in the game world for a short period after you have quit.  Your character will
 be under the control of the server, and may very well die while you are not there to tell it what to do.  So only use this
 command when you are in a rush to leave the game or are in an in-game situation that you can't get out of with the standard
 sit and camp method.  The risk you take when using this shortcut to exit the game is all yours.
 
/random [x, x y] - /random x generates a random number between 0 and x.  /random x y will generate a random number between

 person to send you a /tell.
 
/report <character name> -  Allows a player to report the text that is currently being displayed in the chat window.  If you
 are reporting harassment, bad language, threats, or other actions by another player, use their character name for the 
 <character name> in the report.  If you are reporting falling for 10,000 points damage, or other irregularities that affect
 your character, then use your character's name.  You should then use /petition and let a GM know that you have used /report
 so that they will know to look for your reported text.  To prevent 'spamming', you can only send one report at a time.  You
 can do another /report only after zoning.  Please make sure to have the text you want to report in the chat window when you
 use this command, /report will only send the bottom ten lines of text that are actually shown in your chat window.  Use 
 Shift-Page Up and Shift-Page Down to move through your chat text until you see the text you want to report.

 /split 4 will only split 4 platinum with your group members.  /split 0 0 0 200 will split 200 copper pieces with your group.
 
/stopsong -  Bards can use this command in hotkeys to stop singing their songs.
 
/surname <last name> - Players with a character level 20 or over may use this command to assign a last name to their character.
 Once you have chosen a last name, you will not be able to change it.  So make certain that you choose a name that you like,
 and make certain that the name meets the requirements for our naming policy (see www.everquest.com for more details).
 
/targetgroupbuff - This command toggles on and off when issued.  When on, all group buff spells you cast will require a target
 but will affect everyone grouped (and in range) with that target, even if it is not your own group.  When it is off your

 the closest NPC on top of the tracking list, Consider will put the highest level NPCs on top, Rdistance will  have the 
 closest NPC listed last, Rconsider has the tracking list from low level on top to high level below.  
 
/usercolor [Chat Type] Rvalue Gvalue Bvalue. - For example, For Guild chat to be yellow, you would type /usercolor 4 0 255 255.

***  NEW CHAT CHANNEL HELP SECTION  ***
 
EverQuest players can now open or join as many as 10 chat channels above and beyond the pre-created channels.  The commands
 and discussion below only apply to these player-created channels, not to the game-wide channels such as /ooc or /shout.
 
 
These are a few of the terms used to describe the chat channel functions:
 
[] = optional parameters, <> = required parameters
 
<channel> = <channel-name | 1..10>[:<password>]
<channel-list> = <channel>[,...]
 
This means that any place below where it lists <channel-entry> you can use the <channel-name> with the password after it 
 (don't forget the colon between the two), or just the channel name where no password is in use.
 And any place it lists <channel-list> you can use a series of <channel-entry> separated by commas.
 
For example:  /chat set Voxraidleader:seekrit, Voxraidgroupleader:notsoseekrit, Voxraidgeneral
 That would set three channels (Voxraidleader, Voxraidgroupleader and Voxraidgeneral), two with passwords 
 (seekrit and notsoseekrit).  Though we would suggest shorter channel names...  :)
 
 
Here is a list of the commands available for using chat channels.  After that we'll give a few examples.
 
Note:  Chat channel names are not case sensitive.  You can use all lowercase letters if that makes it easier.  The 
 exception is creating channels.  When you create a channel it will retain the capitalization you use when that name 
 is displayed.  But for any other use in the commands below you can use lowercase letter.
 
 
CHAT SYSTEM COMMAND LIST:
 
/chat set <channel-list>	Makes you a member of all of the channels listed.  You will be joined to those channels
 in the order listed (see /join below for details on what 'joining' a channel means).  This will remove you from all
 previously joined channels.  If you just want to join a new channel, use the /join command
 
/join <channel-list>	Allows you to join the channel or channels listed.  If the channel does not yet exist it will
 create the channel and you will be added as a moderator for the channel (see below for moderator commands).  
 Note:  You may use spaces when creating a channel.  But when the channel is created those spaces will be removed. 
 So if you "/join fluffy bunny" the channel created will be "fluffybunny"
 
/leave <channel>	This will remove you from the channel.  Note:  You must specify a channel, either by name or 
 by number, or the command will fail
 
/leaveall	Removes you from all channels
 
/list [channel]	Using this command without the [channel] parameter will list all of the channels that you are joined to,
 the channel number, and will give a numeric value for the number of people in that channel.  The channel number is 
 specific to individual users, so two people in the same channel may not have the same channel number for that channel.
 Using the command with a [channel] parameter will list the members of the channel by name.
 
/announce [on | off]	Toggles on and off the announcements heard when people join or leave channels.  This is set OFF
 by default.
 
/chat #<channel-name> <message>	Sends the message to the channel named.  You must have the # symbol, that is not a hint
 to use a number.
 
/<1..10> <message>	Sends the message to the chat channel number listed.  You can discover the number of the channels
 you are joined to by using /list.  If no channel number is specified the message will be sent to you first chat channel 
 (whichever is your channel number 1).
 
/chat help	Displays a list of chat channel commands
 
CHANNEL MODERATOR COMMAND LIST:
 
/chat invite <character-name> [channel]	Sends an invitation to the specified character to join a the chat channel.  If no
 channel is specified the character will be invited to join your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1).
 The invitation arrives as a text message.  If the channel is password protected, the invited person can enter the channel
 only once without a password.
 
/chat grant <character-name> [channel]	Grants moderator privileges in the channel specified to the character named.  If no
 channel is specified the character will be given moderator privileges to your first channel (whichever channel is your 
 channel number 1).
 
/chat password <password> [channel]	Sets the password for the channel specified.  If no channel is specified the 
 password will be applied to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1).  Note:  A password protected
 channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent.  Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 
 24 hours.  All other channels cease to exist once they are empty.
 
/chat kick <character-name> [channel]	Kicks the character named off of the chat channel listed.  If no channel is 
 specified the character will be kicked our of your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1)
 
/chat moderate [channel]	Sets the specified channel to 'moderated' mode.  This means that only those given 'voice'
 in the channel will be able to speak in that channel.  If no channel is specified your first channel (whichever channel
 is your channel number 1) will be set into moderated mode.  This is a toggle command, so if you execute this command 
 a second time the channel will return to unmoderated status.
 
/chat voice <character-name> [channel]	Give the named character the ability to speak in a moderated channel.  If no 
 channel is specified the character will be allowed voice in your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1).
 
 
Note:  A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent.  Such a channel will disappear after
 it has been empty for 24 hours.  All other channels cease to exist once they are empty.
 
Note for advanced users:  /chat and / can be replaced with a semicolon ( ; ) in most cases.
 
ASSOCIATED COMMANDS:
 
Here are a few commands that you can use to make your chat channels even more friendly.
 
/autojoin <channel-list>	Saves the channels listed and automatically ;sets you to those channels when you log in.
 This information is saved in your eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section as ChannelAutoJoin=<channel-list>.  
 You can edit that setting in the file while out of game if you wish.
 
/usercolor	See the section in this manual for a description of the use of this command.  The following /usercolor 
 numbers have been added to allow greater customization of your chat channels:
 
	35 - Chat Channel Messages
	36 - Chat Channel 1
	37 - Chat Channel 2
	38 - Chat Channel 3
	39 - Chat Channel 4
	40 - Chat Channel 5
	41 - Chat Channel 6
	42 - Chat Channel 7
	43 - Chat Channel 8
	44 - Chat Channel 9
	45 - Chat Channel 10
 
 
***  HITS MODE  ***   (Combat Text Display Options)
 
/hitsmode allows you to create separate windows for your combat text.  This is a rather advanced feature, so it might 
 take a little practice to get the results that you want.
 
Here is the technical jargon:
 
Usage: /hitsmode <my|me|other> <on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5> <X> <Y> <COUNT> <FONTSIZE> <HEADER> <BG> <WIDTH>
 
my = My Attacks, me = Me Getting Hit, other = Others Attacks
 
If you choose M2 through M5, then:
<X> and <Y> are the screen location.
<COUNT> is how many lines of text will be displayed.  The acceptable range is 1 to 10
<FONTSIZE> is a font size of the text.  The acceptable range is 0, 1, or 2.
<HEADER> is either on or off.  1 to turn on and 0 to turn it off.
<BG> controls the background.  It is either on or off.  1 to turn it on or 0 to turn it off.
<WIDTH> is the width of the background.
 
note: m5 is only valid for My Attacks. It's ignored for other types and m4 is used instead.
 
off - nothing displayed (turns off all these hit messages, including those in the standard chat window)
on - displayed as normal in the chat window (standard/default mode)
M2 - displayed at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. (displays all information 
 shown in the chat damage message)
M3 - displayed in condensed form at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. (damage type,
 target damages and damage amount)
M4 - displayed as just the damage # at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. (only 
 displays damage number).
M5 - displayed in condensed form at given X, Y position (only for My Attacks - displays type of hit and damage number)
 
/clearhits will clear the current setting for the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode command.
 
These setting are saved in the INI file and will be persistent.
 
SPECIAL NOTES:
 
The first time you use this setting, it is best to set all the parameters.  However, you don't have to reset them all
 every time you want to make a change.
 
Using -1 in place of any given parameter will default back to the setting saved in the INI file.  So you can use -1 
 for any parameter that you want to remain as it is while you change others.
 
You can also stop short of full parameters.  If you don't include trailing parameters (for example you leave off <WIDTH>,
 it will use the settings for those parameters from the existing INI.
 
 
EMOTE LISTINGS:
