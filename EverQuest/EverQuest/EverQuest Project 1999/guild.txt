The next step of the guild creation process is to have your guild created in-game. All you need to do is log in to your play server and petition that you are ready to have your guild created.  A Game Master will be with you as soon as possible to finish creating your guild. If you have any problems in having it created due to off peak play time, feel free to email EQGuilds@soe.sony.com and we will work with you to get your guild up and running soon.

Please be aware that there is a 10 member minimum requirement to keep your guild in active status. Should you fall below this number, your guild could be subject to deletion from the server.  We look forward to seeing your guild in the lands of Norrath. Good Luck!
